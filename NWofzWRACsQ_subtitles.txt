837.68 - 837.683.88: chicken farmer you know he looked very
840.639 - 840.6394.041: very
841.56 - 841.565.88: unimpressive he was also very obsessed
844.68 - 844.685.839: with mysticism you know he liked his
847.44 - 847.445.48: kind of runes and his magic and
850.519 - 850.5194.76: occultism so he was really drawn to a
852.92 - 852.924.279: lot of mumbo jumbo if you like Hitler
855.279 - 855.2793.48: didn't have that much time for it but it
857.199 - 857.1994.32: was himler who tried to create this
858.759 - 858.7594.64: whole idea of the SS as almost like a
861.519 - 861.5193.601: kind of King Arthur's Court and he had
863.399 - 863.3994.481: this Castle called velburg in which he
865.12 - 865.125.079: had a room you know to celebrate the
867.88 - 867.883.879: kind of Holiness of the s s know the
870.199 - 870.1994.521: whole thing is kind of Bonkers and
871.759 - 871.7596.041: insane but actually himler beyond all
874.72 - 874.725.52: that nonsense is a really really smart
877.8 - 877.85.24: operator and it's him who gathers so
880.24 - 880.246.959: much power and so much wealth with the
883.04 - 883.046.159: SS he had a lot of sort of psychosomatic
887.199 - 887.1995.08: problems I mean he he was not not a well
889.199 - 889.1995.08: man in many ways but also what he was
892.279 - 892.2794.641: also was was a man who had lots of
894.279 - 894.2795.12: Affairs you know he he used his time
896.92 - 896.924.56: away uh from home to to carry out
899.399 - 899.3994.12: Affairs you know with quite a few people
901.48 - 901.484.279: you don't really want to get too deeply
903.519 - 903.5193.88: into the brains of your Nazi bigwig like
905.759 - 905.7594.481: himler because it's not a nice place to
907.399 - 907.3995.721: be and also he was responsible for the
910.24 - 910.245.2: Holocaust because you know it was the SS
913.12 - 913.124.719: largely who carried it out and when he
915.44 - 915.444.88: went to go and kind of witness a
917.839 - 917.8395.321: Slaughter some brains were splattered
920.32 - 920.324.439: upon his coat and it caused him to vomit
923.16 - 923.163.679: this is the man responsible for it and
924.759 - 924.7593.401: he can't cope with it I'm not saying
926.839 - 926.8393.081: it's desirable that he should have coped
928.16 - 928.163.84: with it but it just shows you that he
929.92 - 929.924.479: didn't actually have the personal
932 - 9324.72: appetite for butchering people himself
934.399 - 934.3995: and got other people to do it in many
936.72 - 936.722.679: ways he was a
940.36 - 940.365.36: coward Joseph Geral cannot live his life
943.279 - 943.2794.48: without Hitler and power along with his
945.72 - 945.726.359: wife they poison their children in the
947.759 - 947.7597.801: fur bunker and then take their own
952.079 - 952.0796.521: lives Joseph Geral is the Nazi
955.56 - 955.566.839: propaganda minister so he's in charge of
958.6 - 958.66.44: cinem books the nent TV industry he's in
962.399 - 962.3995.161: charge of all the methods of
965.04 - 965.045.359: communication and so he's in charge of
967.56 - 967.565.719: getting the Nazi message out effectively
970.399 - 970.3995.321: um and now he is married to a very s
973.279 - 973.2794.281: striking ROM woman called Magda now
975.72 - 975.724: Magda has been married before to a very
977.56 - 977.563.519: wealthy German industrialist but she
979.72 - 979.724.52: eventually gets divorced and marries
981.079 - 981.0794.641: Joseph Gobles who was a real Casanova
984.24 - 984.244.279: actually even though he was short
985.72 - 985.724.919: club-footed and not an attractive man um
988.519 - 988.5194.56: you know he had a lot of sexual
990.639 - 990.6394.721: conquests um and and Magda was one of
993.079 - 993.0796.68: them but actually what you see in the
995.36 - 995.369.039: marriage of Joseph geres and Magda is a
999.759 - 999.7598.041: three-way not in bed but emotionally
1004.399 - 1004.3996.44: between those two and Adolf Hitler
1007.8 - 1007.86: because Adolf Hitler absolutely adored
1010.839 - 1010.8395.321: Magda Gales and thought that she was the
1013.8 - 1013.84.479: kind of perfect Nazi woman you and she
1016.16 - 1016.163.52: was blonde and and she was you know sort
1018.279 - 1018.2794.321: of Viva
1019.68 - 1019.685.159: and she was absolutely devoted to Hitler
1022.6 - 1022.64.4: she absolutely adored him essentially
1024.839 - 1024.8394.36: they were in love with each other but
1027 - 10273.88: also she also loved Gobles and wanted to
1029.199 - 1029.1992.961: have children she had already had some
1030.88 - 1030.882.919: children with a child from her first
1032.16 - 1032.164.639: marriage but she wanted to have more
1033.799 - 1033.7997.201: children and so she and Gobles get
1036.799 - 1036.7997.28: married as a way of both of them to get
1041 - 10415.6: close to Hitler so Hitler goes and
1044.079 - 1044.0794.281: visits the Geral couple Uninvited will
1046.6 - 1046.62.76: spend entire evenings with them until
1048.36 - 1048.363.679: the small
1049.36 - 1049.364.76: chatting away Magda loves that attention
1052.039 - 1052.0394.241: Hitler loves that attention from Magda
1054.12 - 1054.124.439: and Geral is of course jealous but he
1056.28 - 1056.284.639: also loves the fact that he's got the
1058.559 - 1058.5594.441: furer in his living room you know so
1060.919 - 1060.9194.921: he's right at the heart of
1063 - 10634.52: power Gobles is not at that stage in the
1065.84 - 1065.844.44: early stages as important a figure of
1067.52 - 1067.524.72: some like Herman guring um but gerles
1070.28 - 1070.284.72: becomes more important because of this
1072.24 - 1072.246: weird kind of Nazi love triangle if you
1075 - 10756.36: like um and GBL gets very very jealous
1078.24 - 1078.245.76: of of his his wife's relationship with
1081.36 - 1081.364.96: Hitler um and and Hitler really does dot
1084 - 10843.919: on Magda Geral and and you know as a
1086.32 - 1086.324.239: sort of kind of Mark of how much the
1087.919 - 1087.9195.801: couple both love Hitler um they name
1090.559 - 1090.5596.24: their six children all with the letter H
1093.72 - 1093.724.8: you know in in homage to Hitler you know
1096.799 - 1096.7993.441: it it's just shows you how kind of
1098.52 - 1098.524.159: perverted this kind of love and
1100.24 - 1100.242.439: affection
1103.36 - 1103.365.92: is others would rather take their
1106.08 - 1106.084.8: chances and attempt to flee Berlin in
1109.28 - 1109.284.12: the event of Hitler's death the Third
1110.88 - 1110.884.24: Reich obviously completely collapses
1113.4 - 1113.43.759: because it's entirely built on the
1115.12 - 1115.124.559: authority and Charisma of one figure
1117.159 - 1117.1595.041: Hitler himself of course so you know
1119.679 - 1119.6795.201: what is your zealous Nazi going to do
1122.2 - 1122.24.88: well he's got various options one option
1124.88 - 1124.883.72: is to follow the same path as Hitler and
1127.08 - 1127.083.44: think a world without Hitler and a world
1128.6 - 1128.63.72: without nacism is not a world worth
1130.52 - 1130.523.519: living in so you blow yourself up with
1132.32 - 1132.325.359: an AR grenade along with your wife and
1134.039 - 1134.0395.441: kids as one of them did how Charming or
1137.679 - 1137.6794.081: you maybe shoot your or you poison
1139.48 - 1139.484.48: yourself you end your own life or they
1141.76 - 1141.763.799: think I'm going to escape they know that
1143.96 - 1143.963.68: the Allies are going to be after them
1145.559 - 1145.5594.321: many fanatical members of the SS
1147.64 - 1147.644.96: especially know that they've committed
1149.88 - 1149.884.12: war crimes they may deny to themselves
1152.6 - 1152.63.28: that these things are actually crimes
1154 - 11543.799: but they know that if you you know
1155.88 - 1155.884: slaughter people on on the battlefield
1157.799 - 1157.7993.481: after they surrendered or if you decide
1159.88 - 1159.883.679: that what you want to do is to gas a
1161.28 - 1161.284.16: million Jews to death that that might be
1163.559 - 1163.5594.441: seen as criminal amongst reasonable
1165.44 - 1165.444.32: thinking people so um what they do a lot
1168 - 11683.48: of these naziis figures they decide they
1169.76 - 1169.763.32: they need to go into hiding now what
1171.48 - 1171.484.199: they can't do is just you know get on a
1173.08 - 1173.085.16: plane and go to Buenos Aris or or
1175.679 - 1175.6794.641: Damascus you know they have to sort of
1178.24 - 1178.245.04: Disguise their identities they have to
1180.32 - 1180.325.2: sort of you know blend in with with with
1183.28 - 1183.284.48: the refugees they have to blend in with
1185.52 - 1185.524.12: the normal German soldiers you know
1187.76 - 1187.763.88: Marching In These great columns you know
1189.64 - 1189.644.24: retreating so you know it's a very
1191.64 - 1191.645.2: confused very muddle time and a lot of
1193.88 - 1193.885.32: senior Nazis and not so senior Nazis try
1196.84 - 1196.844.6: to blend in
1199.2 - 1199.24.32: the Allies are closing in and the odds
1201.44 - 1201.445.599: of a successful Escape are diminishing
1203.52 - 1203.524.96: day by day Allied soldiers know who to
1207.039 - 1207.0394.281: look
1208.48 - 1208.485.76: for their time is
1211.32 - 1211.324.359: up Herman guring was considered Hitler's
1214.24 - 1214.244.559: successor by the
1215.679 - 1215.6796.281: allies and therefore was Target number
1218.799 - 1218.7995.521: one the US Army are catching up entering
1221.96 - 1221.965.599: Berlin with a firm plan to capture as
1224.32 - 1224.325.52: many Nazi officials as they can their
1227.559 - 1227.5594.401: aim to bring them before a court on
1229.84 - 1229.844.959: trial for the atrocities they helped
1231.96 - 1231.964.92: make possible in 1943 there was this
1234.799 - 1234.7994: thing called the Moscow declaration that
1236.88 - 1236.884.84: announced that all these criminals would
1238.799 - 1238.7995.641: be chased quote to the utmost ends of
1241.72 - 1241.725.319: the Earth and brought to Justice now
1244.44 - 1244.444.88: this was to achieve two things first to
1247.039 - 1247.0393.561: tell any Nazi war criminal we're on to
1249.32 - 1249.322.4: you you're not going to get away with
1250.6 - 1250.62.6: what you're doing because we're going to
1251.72 - 1251.722.76: win this war and then we're going to
1253.2 - 1253.23.08: come and find you and then we're going
1254.48 - 1254.483.199: to come and bring you to Justice and
1256.28 - 1256.283.36: also the people in the occupied
1257.679 - 1257.6794.561: territories could see the Moscow
1259.64 - 1259.645.159: declaration and go good the Allies are
1262.24 - 1262.244.72: going to do something about this um and
1264.799 - 1264.7993.841: it means that these people may commit
1266.96 - 1266.963.36: fewer criminal acts against us if
1268.64 - 1268.644.159: they're worried that when the war's over
1270.32 - 1270.326.719: the Allies are going to come and get
1272.799 - 1272.7998.041: them the international Manhunt
1277.039 - 1277.0396.76: begins we went in hiding from Holland
1280.84 - 1280.845.8: but I've been born in Vienna and when
1283.799 - 1283.7996.081: the Nazis came there their population
1286.64 - 1286.645.56: changed immediately was quite quite
1289.88 - 1289.884.6: shocking and amazing we had many
1292.2 - 1292.26.04: non-jewish friends and they all turned
1294.48 - 1294.486.48: against us so um you know that was for
1298.24 - 1298.245.559: me as a child something I couldn't
1300.96 - 1300.967.88: understand at all we were Jewish but not
1303.799 - 1303.7998.24: religious and um you know I this was I
1308.84 - 1308.846.68: think I was nine at the time you know
1312.039 - 1312.0395.64: this was a big big shock for me and then
1315.52 - 1315.524.68: we went first to Belgium where I was not
1317.679 - 1317.6795.48: accepted and didn't know the language
1320.2 - 1320.25.2: then eventually we settled in Amsterdam
1323.159 - 1323.1595.561: which was wonderful the Dutch were very
1325.4 - 1325.45.399: very welcoming and I made many friends
1328.72 - 1328.726.4: and I looked that blonde hair and blue
1330.799 - 1330.7997.041: eyes got a bicycle and I felt now and we
1335.12 - 1335.126.24: were together as a family so I thought
1337.84 - 1337.845.839: it's okay but then within three months
1341.36 - 1341.364.199: the Germans invaded Holland and
1343.679 - 1343.6795: everything collapsed
1345.559 - 1345.5596.441: again and the measures against Jewish
1348.679 - 1348.6796.161: people came up first slowly but then
1352 - 13528.44: more dangerous people
1354.84 - 1354.845.6: disappeared and then in 42 we went into
1363.24 - 1363.245.4: hiding legalized discrimination of the
1366.08 - 1366.086.76: Jews in Germany began immediately after
1368.64 - 1368.646.639: the Nazi seizure of power in January
1372.84 - 1372.846.12: [Music]
1375.279 - 1375.2795.921: 1933 Hitler had made his anti-Semitic VI
1378.96 - 1378.963.92: public from the moment he reached total
1381.2 - 1381.24.32: control of
1382.88 - 1382.885.32: Germany laws were introduced to
1385.52 - 1385.526.44: discriminate and dehumanize the Jews
1388.2 - 1388.23.76: stripping them of their German
1392.72 - 1392.724.52: citizenships violence and economic
1395 - 13954.679: pressure were tactics used by the Nazi
1397.24 - 1397.243.52: regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily
1399.679 - 1399.6794: leave the
1400.76 - 1400.764.64: country anti-Semitism was being taught
1403.679 - 1403.6794.401: to the
1405.4 - 1405.43.59: population and everyone was too afraid
1408.08 - 1408.085.31: to oppos
1408.99 - 1408.994.4: [Music]
1423.48 - 1423.484.4: it so we know that from as early as
1426.039 - 1426.0394.681: Hitler's writings in mind camp that he
1427.88 - 1427.884.76: was personally anti-semitic and what we
1430.72 - 1430.724.439: see once the third Right comes into
1432.64 - 1432.644.56: power is his personal anti-Semitism
1435.159 - 1435.1594.52: translated into State
1437.2 - 1437.26.359: policy so so from the very earliest days
1439.679 - 1439.6796.6: and months of the Third Reich um there
1443.559 - 1443.5595.081: were many different measures legal
1446.279 - 1446.2795.681: measures um taken against the Jews and
1448.64 - 1448.643.32: also illegal measures as
1454.48 - 1454.486.48: well just as he had promised in mine
1457.72 - 1457.726.64: Camp Hitler is treating the Jews in
1460.96 - 1460.967.52: Germany as an internal enemy so what you
1464.36 - 1464.366.84: see are nors stripping Jews of their
1468.48 - 1468.484.6: German citizenship U you see awful
1471.2 - 1471.24: things like um Jews not being allowed to
1473.08 - 1473.083.599: go to swimming pools because if a Jew
1475.2 - 1475.23.44: swam in a public swimming pool the water
1476.679 - 1476.6794.041: would have to be drained because the Jew
1478.64 - 1478.645.039: had dirtied the water so you can see
1480.72 - 1480.725.36: that you've got this sort of awful awful
1483.679 - 1483.6796.081: both political and cultural exclusion of
1486.08 - 1486.083.68: of of the Jewish community
1501.33 - 1501.332.31: [Music]
1502.48 - 1502.484.799: when we get to
1503.64 - 1503.645.8: 1938 um we come to quite a key moment in
1507.279 - 1507.2794.801: the history of Nazi anti-Semitism we
1509.44 - 1509.443.68: come to the night of the 9th to 10th of
1512.08 - 1512.084.04: November
1513.12 - 1513.125.72: 1938 um to a night known as rice Crystal
1516.12 - 1516.127.159: KN Crystal KN or the KN of the broken
1518.84 - 1518.847.959: glass the Nazis just literally set fire
1523.279 - 1523.2795.961: to synagogues everywhere um and and it's
1526.799 - 1526.7994.76: They smash up Jewish shop and and Jews
1529.24 - 1529.244.159: are killed near on 100 people were
1531.559 - 1531.5593.24: killed in the course of the night and
1533.399 - 1533.3994.041: between 20 and
1534.799 - 1534.7995.441: 30,000 German Jews were taken to
1537.44 - 1537.442.8: concentration
1540.96 - 1540.966.4: camps this absolutely horrific
1543.799 - 1543.7996.76: destruction Slaughter violence carried
1547.36 - 1547.366.319: out by the State against its own people
1550.559 - 1550.5595.161: it showed the world what Hitler was he
1553.679 - 1553.6795.041: was effectively A Gangster and a
1555.72 - 1555.723: murderer
1564.76 - 1564.764.12: after the night of the broken glass the
1566.96 - 1566.964.24: situation for Germany's Jews just got
1568.88 - 1568.884.56: worse and worse from then until the war
1571.2 - 1571.24.8: and of course during the war as
1573.44 - 1573.445: well they were impoverished they were
1576 - 15764.76: made to pay a big atonement uh fine
1578.44 - 1578.443.92: money was taken from them um in order to
1580.76 - 1580.763.92: pay for This calamity that they'd
1582.36 - 1582.365.52: allegedly brought upon themselves
1584.68 - 1584.683.2: [Music]
1588.6 - 1588.64.24: there's no doubt about the centrality of
1591.039 - 1591.0393.921: anti-Semitism to Hitler's worldview
1592.84 - 1592.843.559: there's absolutely no doubt about that
1594.96 - 1594.963.12: but what he seemed to be trying to do
1596.399 - 1596.3993.64: was sort of stay in the shadow so that
1598.08 - 1598.083.68: when we get a program like this that the
1600.039 - 1600.0393.76: public the German public and the
1601.76 - 1601.763.44: population were quite affronted by it
1603.799 - 1603.7993.281: there's that idea then that Hitler was
1605.2 - 1605.23.959: sort of staying in the shadows and not
1607.08 - 1607.084.64: being associated with
1609.159 - 1609.1594.841: that there was certainly that sentiment
1611.72 - 1611.725.199: among the German population because of
1614 - 16145.039: this myth that surrounded the fura that
1616.919 - 1616.9193.841: well if there were unpleasant things
1619.039 - 1619.0394.281: going on or policies that they didn't
1620.76 - 1620.765.12: like all of those sort of more difficult
1623.32 - 1623.324.079: aspects of the third R then somehow that
1625.88 - 1625.883.36: Hitler couldn't know about it that he
1627.399 - 1627.3993.52: wasn't associated with it that it had to
1629.24 - 1629.243.559: be one of the other leaders it can't
1630.919 - 1630.9194.441: have been him if only the furer knew
1632.799 - 1632.7992.561: this wouldn't be
1636.88 - 1636.886.159: happening we didn't know what they had
1640.2 - 1640.26.199: done you know everything was Kept Secret
1643.039 - 1643.0395.64: because a were Nazis in Holland as well
1646.399 - 1646.3994.16: and like the end unfort fortunately
1648.679 - 1648.6797.321: there were people who betrayed Jewish
1650.559 - 1650.5599.441: people as well so in 44 we were betrayed
1656 - 16566.88: by Dutch nurse who was a double agent
1660 - 16605.88: worked really for the
1662.88 - 1662.884.6: Nazis you were not allowed to walk on
1665.88 - 1665.883.919: the Pavements they had to walk in the
1667.48 - 1667.485.16: gutters Jews were not allowed to
1669.799 - 1669.7995.76: practice their professions my M my
1672.64 - 1672.645.279: father couldn't go to work anymore at
1675.559 - 1675.5596.6: first we had to wear an arm band a white
1677.919 - 1677.9196.921: AR with a blue star of David on it they
1682.159 - 1682.1595.64: later changed it to a yellow star which
1684.84 - 1684.845.48: we had to wear old Jews in Europe had to
1687.799 - 1687.7994.281: wear it one in the front one in the back
1690.32 - 1690.324.68: if you walked out without it you could
1692.08 - 1692.084.719: have been shot Hitler made the German
1695 - 16954.12: people believe that the Jews were the
1696.799 - 1696.7995.36: source of all their problems learning
1699.12 - 1699.125.439: from the T4 program the idea of the
1702.159 - 1702.1597.24: total extermination of the Jewish race
1704.559 - 1704.5597.24: was developed further on July 31st 1941
1709.399 - 1709.3994.64: Herman guring gave written authorization
1711.799 - 1711.7994.88: to Reinhard hadrick chief of the Reich

1724.24 - 1724.244.52: who truly even today makes one's blood
1726.6 - 1726.63.919: run cold you just have to look at the
1728.76 - 1728.764.919: man to see his
1730.519 - 1730.5196.201: evil he is a red doubtable leader he's

1751.399 - 1751.3997.52: tea everything is done evly cruel
1755.76 - 1755.766.639: ruthless unemotional way in which he can

1802.76 - 1802.766.279: would be killed the conference only
1805.48 - 1805.485.72: lasted around 90 minutes at the time of
1809.039 - 1809.0394.961: the conference Jews were already being
1811.2 - 1811.24.92: murdered in the Soviet Union a new
1814 - 18145: extermination camp under construction at
1816.12 - 1816.125.559: belac and other extermination camps were
1819 - 18192.679: in the planning
1824.799 - 1824.7996.441: stages the decision to exterminate Jews
1828.32 - 1828.322.92: had already been
1833.36 - 1833.365.319: made an awful Injustice imposed on the
1837.279 - 1837.2793.721: Jewish
1838.679 - 1838.6794.6: people the murdering of Jews was
1841 - 18415.679: regarded as such a simple task for the
1843.279 - 1843.2795.4: SS to undertake these people are not
1846.679 - 1846.6794.441: human they are not of the same
1848.679 - 1848.6795.401: importance as the Aryan bred
1851.12 - 1851.126.24: Germans we must feel no guilt in
1854.08 - 1854.085.479: eliminating them from our world all
1857.36 - 1857.364.279: members of the Nazi party were required
1859.559 - 1859.5594.641: to play a part in the final solution as
1861.639 - 1861.6396: it was genocide on a mass scale
1864.2 - 1864.23.439: therefore needed Mass
1870.679 - 1870.6794.281: participation the conditions in which
1872.88 - 1872.887.679: the Jews were subjected to were
1874.96 - 1874.965.599: demoralizing dehumanizing and entirely
1884.639 - 1884.6395.241: corrupt our heads were shaved we went
1887.6 - 1887.64.919: through cold communal
1889.88 - 1889.886.84: showers and when we got out at the other
1892.519 - 1892.5197.241: end we got our concentration camp G the
1896.72 - 1896.726.12: strip jackets and and
1899.76 - 1899.765.56: skirts and when we looked at one another
1902.84 - 1902.844.839: we're still the same group but we just
1905.32 - 1905.324.359: looked so different that we couldn't
1907.679 - 1907.6794.521: recognize each
1909.679 - 1909.6794.561: other the these are places that are are
1912.2 - 1912.24.359: places of deep deep horror because you
1914.24 - 1914.245: didn't go there to work you went there
1916.559 - 1916.5595.881: to die and you would arrive and with
1919.24 - 1919.247.12: within 30 minutes you'd be dead my
1922.44 - 1922.447.839: father even said you know we're just
1926.36 - 1926.366.88: going to work and go home he told it's
1930.279 - 1930.2792.961: not what
1933.84 - 1933.845.719: happened my father was taken to the
1936.44 - 1936.447.9: guest chamber and my mother as
1939.559 - 1939.5597.281: well and I was left with my
1944.34 - 1944.345.86: [Music]
1946.84 - 1946.846.4: sister blinker for example is no bigger
1950.2 - 1950.25.68: if you visit it than a football stadium
1953.24 - 1953.247.039: the size of a football pitch and in that
1955.88 - 1955.886.08: very small area around 850,000 men women
1960.279 - 1960.2793.88: and children were
1961.96 - 1961.963.88: gassed and it it's just the most
1964.159 - 1964.1594.081: horrific thought if you ever visit a
1965.84 - 1965.842.4: place like
1968.279 - 1968.2796.601: that Jews were slaughtered um just by
1971.88 - 1971.886.039: being shot next to vast pits which would
1974.88 - 1974.884.88: then just be you know buried over and
1977.919 - 1977.9194.72: and and this was just the most horrific
1979.76 - 1979.764.799: form o of genocide I mean gassing of
1982.639 - 1982.6394.121: course is horrific too but you know the
1984.559 - 1984.5594.521: idea that you would just shoot a baby in
1986.76 - 1986.764.159: the head in front of its mother and then
1989.08 - 1989.083.719: shoot the mother and this would be your
1990.919 - 1990.9194.201: day in day out
1992.799 - 1992.7995.561: job it Beggar's belief that that
1995.12 - 1995.124.96: supposedly ordinary men in these SS
1998.36 - 1998.363.919: police battalions could go around doing
2000.08 - 2000.084.68: this kind of work but they did and it
2002.279 - 2002.2795: was eventually recognized by the Nazis
2004.76 - 2004.765.039: that actually the kind of psychological
2007.279 - 2007.2794.441: toll it was having on those carrying out
2009.799 - 2009.7994.88: the murders was so great that they had
2011.72 - 2011.725.48: to work out a nicer way to kill Jews I.E
2014.679 - 2014.6795.12: through maybe lores with gas going into
2017.2 - 2017.24.68: them or or maybe even gas Chambers SO
2019.799 - 2019.7994.921: gas Chambers are actually invented
2021.88 - 2021.888: primarily to spare the sanity of the
2024.72 - 2024.725.16: murderers that's how twisted Nazi logic
2030.24 - 2030.245.24: becomes when we went to bed we weren't
2032.919 - 2032.9195.321: sure that we'll wake up in the morning
2035.48 - 2035.484.52: all of us were the same and if you wake
2038.24 - 2038.243.2: up you couldn't be sure that you would
2040 - 20403.88: still be alive in the evening you
2041.44 - 2041.445.199: couldn't if you couldn't get off the
2043.88 - 2043.886.12: bank you were finished yes I've been
2046.639 - 2046.6396.601: asked asked in the past whether I had
2050 - 20504.879: any thoughts of what would we do after
2053.24 - 2053.244.32: our
2054.879 - 2054.8795.561: Liberation it's it's uh an impossible
2057.56 - 2057.565: question because in the camp our
2060.44 - 2060.444.719: thoughts were just how to survive that
2062.56 - 2062.565.16: day how to stay out of
2065.159 - 2065.1595.401: trouble because the safest thing to do
2067.72 - 2067.726: was to be anonymous not to be noticed if
2070.56 - 2070.565.839: he did anything wrong um that usually
2073.72 - 2073.722.679: spelled
2082.159 - 2082.1595.041: trouble I think it's important to say
2084.359 - 2084.3595.081: that the perpetrators really sort of had
2087.2 - 2087.24.12: this sense of impunity really
2089.44 - 2089.443.6: perpetrators of these kinds of crimes
2091.32 - 2091.323.599: until that point of nurenberg so there
2093.04 - 2093.045.88: was this sense that they'd get away with
2094.919 - 2094.9195.761: it so Hitler very famously told his SS
2098.92 - 2098.923.64: during the second world war who now
2100.68 - 2100.683.679: remembers the Armenians and the
2102.56 - 2102.563.84: Armenians had been the victims of a
2104.359 - 2104.3594.281: genocide during the course of the first
2106.4 - 2106.44.32: world war there' sort of been a lot of
2108.64 - 2108.643.719: talk at that point about bringing the
2110.72 - 2110.724.399: perpetrators to justice but they'd all
2112.359 - 2112.3594.801: got away with it after 1945 this began
2115.119 - 2115.1194.681: to change and the laws international law
2117.16 - 2117.167.199: began to change as
2119.8 - 2119.89.76: well Nazi officials knew that they were
2124.359 - 2124.3595.201: Wanted Dead or Alive
2129.64 - 2129.646.24: their Terror and Corruption had been
2131.839 - 2131.8395.681: exposed to the world and now they were
2135.88 - 2135.884.959: going to
2137.52 - 2137.525.52: pay now what this leads to is what is
2140.839 - 2140.8396.041: called the international Military
2143.04 - 2143.046.4: Tribunal or the IMT at the German city
2146.88 - 2146.884.199: of nurmberg which was a kind of cradle
2149.44 - 2149.444.08: of Nazism it was where you had all these
2151.079 - 2151.0794.121: massive na rallies and this
2153.52 - 2153.524.799: International Military Tribunal which we
2155.2 - 2155.25.56: now today call the nurenberg tri trials
2158.319 - 2158.3194.601: took place at the palace of Justice in
2160.76 - 2160.765.4: nurburg uh largely because it was
2162.92 - 2162.928.36: relatively unbedded but also it was very
2166.16 - 2166.166.88: symbolic and from about 1945 46 to 49
2171.28 - 2171.283.96: there were several trials that took
2173.04 - 2173.044.76: place at neurenberg but the one that
2175.24 - 2175.244.68: most people associate is the
2177.8 - 2177.85.799: international Military Tribunal of
2179.92 - 2179.925.919: around 20 top Nazi figures and that was
2183.599 - 2183.5996.401: to show the world that actually there
2185.839 - 2185.8397.041: could be some Justice Meed out not just
2190 - 21905.72: by one country but all the Allies the
2192.88 - 2192.885.56: French the Russians the Americans and
2195.72 - 2195.724.359: the British it was very radical at the
2198.44 - 2198.443.879: time there had never been an
2200.079 - 2200.0794.201: international criminal court like it and
2202.319 - 2202.3194.76: so this was a kind of coming together of
2204.28 - 2204.285.079: a lot of different legal systems a lot
2207.079 - 2207.0794.201: of different political systems what it
2209.359 - 2209.3593.96: was saying to the world was listen these
2211.28 - 2211.284.039: people who commit war crimes these
2213.319 - 2213.3194.04: people who commit genocide these people
2215.319 - 2215.3194.28: who commit crimes against humanity they
2217.359 - 2217.3595.201: are are never ever going to get away
2219.599 - 2219.5992.961: with it ever
2222.68 - 2222.686.159: again the Allied Forces Britain France
2226.16 - 2226.164.199: the United States and Russia all came to
2228.839 - 2228.8393.561: the agreement that they wanted to
2230.359 - 2230.3594.161: prosecute any living Nazi party
2232.4 - 2232.44.76: officials for the crime they had
2234.52 - 2234.524.44: committed the four Allied countries all
2237.16 - 2237.163.679: had different Justice systems and
2238.96 - 2238.963.68: decided that rather than try each Man
2240.839 - 2240.8394: four times they should come up with an
2242.64 - 2242.644.92: agreement on how they would run the
2244.839 - 2244.8396: trials the London Charter for the near
2247.56 - 2247.565.559: ber trials held in August 1945 saw the
2250.839 - 2250.8394.76: Allied countries agree on a trial and
2253.119 - 2253.1195.281: tribunal court system in which each
2255.599 - 2255.5994.961: country would have a judge present they
2258.4 - 2258.44.52: decided on three major charges that the
2260.56 - 2260.564.48: Nazi officials would face and that they
2262.92 - 2262.924.439: would each be allowed a defending
2265.04 - 2265.044: Council the prisoners are kept under day
2267.359 - 2267.3596.601: and night surveillance by United States
2269.04 - 2269.044.92: armed guards they are fed like ordinary
2275.68 - 2275.684.84: criminals and as Robert Jackson Chief
2278.359 - 2278.3594.561: American prosecutor completes his case
2280.52 - 2280.524.24: plans move ahead through this tunnel the
2282.92 - 2282.923.76: Nazis will be taken to the courtroom now
2284.76 - 2284.764.24: being rebuilt for the trial of mid
2286.68 - 2286.684.48: November the indictment represents the
2289 - 22894.319: first time four different nations and
2291.16 - 2291.164.72: systems of Justice have been welded to
2293.319 - 2293.3194.76: try war criminals it also condemns the
2295.88 - 2295.884.8: whole Nazi party for crimes against
2298.079 - 2298.0795.801: humanity Justice catches up with the
2300.68 - 2300.683.2: monsters of
2305.119 - 2305.1195.321: fascism the trial was set to put the
2307.8 - 2307.84.92: horrors of the Nazi regime on display
2310.44 - 2310.445.28: for the world to
2312.72 - 2312.724.92: see and the Allies chose nurenberg as
2315.72 - 2315.724.24: quite a Fitting Place I think because
2317.64 - 2317.644.52: nurburg first of all as the second
2319.96 - 2319.964.639: largest city in Bavaria was kind of at
2322.16 - 2322.165.72: the heartland of the sort of rise to
2324.599 - 2324.5995.041: power of the Nazis but also it was the
2327.88 - 2327.884.56: place where the Nazi race laws the
2329.64 - 2329.645.28: nurenberg laws were promulgated in
2332.44 - 2332.444.679: 1935 as well it was maybe the
2334.92 - 2334.925.32: predominant reason that it was where the
2337.119 - 2337.1195.441: n party held its annual party rallies
2340.24 - 2340.246.28: nurburg so very very focal point of the
2342.56 - 2342.566.92: regime and I think that they hoped that
2346.52 - 2346.525.559: by holding the international Military
2349.48 - 2349.485.16: Tribunal and other trials that followed
2352.079 - 2352.0794.801: there that it would be a place where
2354.64 - 2354.646.12: they could bring some kind of closure to
2356.88 - 2356.886.8: the Nazi regime and to its
2360.76 - 2360.765.359: atrocities with plans to broadcast live
2363.68 - 2363.685.48: this trial would go down in history one
2366.119 - 2366.1195.761: of the most symbolic executions of
2369.16 - 2369.165.679: Justice the world would not tolerate
2371.88 - 2371.886.6: such hate crimes ever
2374.839 - 2374.8396.48: again the nurenberg trials represented a
2378.48 - 2378.486.359: very important moment an unprecedented
2381.319 - 2381.3196.321: moment and a way for the Allied Powers
2384.839 - 2384.8395.161: really to bring to Justice some of those
2387.64 - 2387.645.56: key Nazi leaders as representatives of
2390 - 23905.88: key Nazi organizations who had carried
2393.2 - 2393.25.56: out such unspeakably cruel acts of
2395.88 - 2395.885.719: crimes against the peace war crimes and
2398.76 - 2398.762.839: crimes against
2401.76 - 2401.765.16: humanity the international Military
2404.28 - 2404.284.799: Tribunal formed by the Allies was given
2406.92 - 2406.924.399: the task of trying 24 of the most
2409.079 - 2409.0794.121: important political and military leaders

2447.599 - 2447.5995.24: name of the
2449.88 - 2449.888.88: law but who would they manage to put on
2452.839 - 2452.8395.921: trial and who would evade Justice
2460.319 - 2460.3194.641: persecution of the Jews was a continuous
2463.24 - 2463.244.64: and deliberate
2464.96 - 2464.965.76: policy it was a policy directed against

2984.44 - 2984.443.24: have been
2985.319 - 2985.3194.321: hanged it is kind of fascinating to
2987.68 - 2987.684.96: speculate what Hitler might have been
2989.64 - 2989.644.52: like in the doc at nurburg I suspect he

3207.16 - 3207.164.919: on the other hand in answer to the

3212.079 - 3212.0793.401: that the defendant is not capable of
3214.28 - 3214.284.519: defending
3215.48 - 3215.486.4: himself he has refused every simple
3218.799 - 3218.7995.441: treatment that has been suggested he's

3233.079 - 3233.0795.081: trial Albert Spear took his time in the
3236.04 - 3236.043.64: dock to deflect the blame onto his
3238.16 - 3238.165.32: fellow party
3239.68 - 3239.686.48: members you were present on April 23rd

3249.04 - 3249.044.44: power what did Hitler say on that
3256.04 - 3256.044.72: occasion Hitler was most excited about
3258.52 - 3258.524.12: the contents of the telegram and he
3260.76 - 3260.764.559: expressed himself in a very clear manner
3262.64 - 3262.645.04: about guring he said that he knew for
3265.319 - 3265.3195.121: some time that guring had failed that he
3267.68 - 3267.684.6: was corrupt that he was a drug addict it
3270.44 - 3270.444: was typical of Hitler's attitude toward
3272.28 - 3272.284.48: the entire problem however that he
3274.44 - 3274.445.44: followed this statement up by saying but
3276.76 - 3276.765.319: he can nevertheless negotiate the
3279.88 - 3279.884.52: capitulation he stated in an off-hand
3282.079 - 3282.0795.321: manner it doesn't really matter who does
3284.4 - 3284.46.199: it his disregard for the German nation
3287.4 - 3287.46.24: was expressed in the way he said
3290.599 - 3290.5995.881: this the tremendous danger contained in
3293.64 - 3293.644.679: this totalitarian system only became
3296.48 - 3296.483.48: really clear the moment we were
3298.319 - 3298.3193.961: approaching the
3299.96 - 3299.964.48: end everything that has happened during
3302.28 - 3302.284.279: this trial everything you have seen in
3304.44 - 3304.444.6: the way of orders which were carried out
3306.559 - 3306.5594.161: without any hesitation did after all
3309.04 - 3309.044.64: turn out to be
3310.72 - 3310.725.399: mistaken that is why this trial must
3313.68 - 3313.685.28: contribute to the prevention of such
3316.119 - 3316.1197.041: distorted wars in the future and to the
3318.96 - 3318.966.68: establishment of principles for human
3323.16 - 3323.164.919: cooperation however of the top Nazi
3325.64 - 3325.644.04: officials Herman guring is considered
3328.079 - 3328.0794.681: the highest ranking Nazi to have
3329.68 - 3329.684.6: survived the war and therefore the main
3332.76 - 3332.764.4: target for the
3334.28 - 3334.286: prosecution guring had great persuasion
3337.16 - 3337.165.48: and power during the Nazi regime being
3340.28 - 3340.285.72: named Hitler's successor by the furer
3342.64 - 3342.645.479: himself Herman guring believed he was
3346 - 33464.92: invincible he goes from being a first
3348.119 - 3348.1195.2: world war fighter pilot hero who's got
3350.92 - 3350.924.52: the uh polar mer medal which is the
3353.319 - 3353.3194.28: highest medal that can be won by the
3355.44 - 3355.445.44: German fighting man in the first world
3357.599 - 3357.5994.641: war and so he's a venerated pilot very
3360.88 - 3360.883.6: successful fighter pilot during the
3362.24 - 3362.244.04: first world war who then kind of loses
3364.48 - 3364.484.04: his way somewhat and then when he falls
3366.28 - 3366.284.4: in with the Nazis in Munich in the 20s
3368.52 - 3368.525.24: he's feeling that's giving him a kind of
3370.68 - 3370.686.08: sense of purpose and the problem is is
3373.76 - 3373.766.16: that he's on the famous Beall pch in
3376.76 - 3376.766.319: 1923 and he gets shot and wounded and
3379.92 - 3379.926.159: when he's recuperating from his wounds
3383.079 - 3383.0795.52: he's given morphine heroin effectively
3386.079 - 3386.0794.801: and and it's that that he becomes
3388.599 - 3388.5995.121: addicted to and it's at nurenberg when
3390.88 - 3390.885.08: he's off the drugs when he loses weight
3393.72 - 3393.724.2: his brain sudden get sharper again and
3395.96 - 3395.964.28: of all the Nazis in the dock at Newberg
3397.92 - 3397.924.6: he's the most impressive and that old
3400.24 - 3400.244.64: flash of intelligence and Brilliance
3402.52 - 3402.526.079: that's got into the top of the Nazi tree
3404.88 - 3404.885.52: is shown once more ging's trial at nurg
3408.599 - 3408.5993.881: was set to be one of the most
3410.4 - 3410.45.24: significant trials at
3412.48 - 3412.485.96: nberg he provided the last direct link
3415.64 - 3415.646.28: to Hitler assuming that Martin Borman
3418.44 - 3418.445.399: was in fact dead the way guring treated
3421.92 - 3421.924.8: the Jews and his obsession with the
3423.839 - 3423.8396.24: German economy was completely
3426.72 - 3426.725.56: inhumane he used threats and force to
3430.079 - 3430.0795.161: get other leaders to coincide with Nazi
3432.28 - 3432.286.12: actions and was intense on his use of
3435.24 - 3435.245.96: slave laborers everywhere throughout the
3438.4 - 3438.46.28: whole regime he was Hitler's wingman and
3441.2 - 3441.26.919: an active part of the entire Nazi
3444.68 - 3444.686.439: movement now his fear had left him to
3448.119 - 3448.1193: deal with the
3453.16 - 3453.163.56: consequences now the whole idea of the
3455.039 - 3455.0393.201: Reich was not meant to be a 12year Reich
3456.72 - 3456.723.56: it was supposed to be a Thousand-Year
3458.24 - 3458.243.839: Reich and in fact that what was going to

4181.799 - 4181.7995.241: zealously implemented it and he knew
4184.159 - 4184.1595: that if he was captured um he would face
4187.04 - 4187.042.119: The

4203.12 - 4203.127.24: came to face two of the most horrific
4206.04 - 4206.046.92: members of the Nazi party Rudolph hurse
4210.36 - 4210.365.799: and Joseph
4212.96 - 4212.966: mangola Rudolph hurse longest serving

4218.96 - 4218.964.32: accelerate Hitler's plan to
4220.679 - 4220.6796.04: systematically exterminate the Jewish
4223.28 - 4223.285.6: population he introduced Z CL b a gas
4226.719 - 4226.7194.44: containing hydrogen cyanide to be used
4228.88 - 4228.883.76: in the gas Chambers speeding up the
4231.159 - 4231.1594.921: process of
4232.64 - 4232.646.44: elimination he typified the quiet and
4236.08 - 4236.085.2: bureaucratic mass murderer um very
4239.08 - 4239.084.48: conscientious very determined to do his
4241.28 - 4241.284.16: job and to do it well and of course
4243.56 - 4243.563.84: without much thought for the victim so
4245.44 - 4245.444.36: in terms of what he was doing at aitz
4247.4 - 4247.44.04: trying to make a very efficient machine
4249.8 - 4249.83.72: and trying to do his job well and
4251.44 - 4251.444.04: properly his concern was not with the
4253.52 - 4253.524.36: victims but just to make sure that the
4255.48 - 4255.484.6: apparatus was working well so in this
4257.88 - 4257.885: case to ensure that the gas Chambers
4260.08 - 4260.082.8: could operate
4262.92 - 4262.927: efficiently he gave the impression of a
4266.04 - 4266.045.199: quiet family man so this beled his role
4269.92 - 4269.924.64: as such an
4271.239 - 4271.2396.44: important member of the SS so in command
4274.56 - 4274.565.28: of the of the most notorious of the
4277.679 - 4277.6794.52: death camps and indeed the biggest
4279.84 - 4279.845.52: killing Center of all
4282.199 - 4282.1995.081: time he treated the mass murder that
4285.36 - 4285.364.16: went on there just as a kind of routine
4287.28 - 4287.283.6: and ordinary business as usual really
4289.52 - 4289.523.4: very much as a kind of ordinary
4290.88 - 4290.883.64: procedure and process and he was
4292.92 - 4292.925.48: concerned with the procedure and the
4294.52 - 4294.523.88: process not with the fate of his
4298.44 - 4298.445.92: victims families would be torn apart
4302.159 - 4302.1594.641: some being spared from extermination to
4304.36 - 4304.365.2: work for the Nazis in the camp whilst
4306.8 - 4306.86.52: others would face the shower block
4309.56 - 4309.566.56: unknowingly walking to their own death
4313.32 - 4313.326.04: between 1933 and
4316.12 - 4316.126.599: 1945 the Nazis were very much concerned
4319.36 - 4319.365.24: to purify and cleanse German society and
4322.719 - 4322.7194.841: they put into place a whole range of
4324.6 - 4324.64.8: measures and laws in order to do this
4327.56 - 4327.564.119: one of the early laws uh was the
4329.4 - 4329.44.799: sterilization law which was to stop
4331.679 - 4331.6795.641: hereditary diseases going down
4334.199 - 4334.1995.561: Generations ultimately during the war
4337.32 - 4337.325.6: there was the youth in Asia campaign uh
4339.76 - 4339.765.479: which was code named action T4 which was
4342.92 - 4342.924.719: essentially the mass murder of the
4345.239 - 4345.2394.561: Asylum population so the mentally and
4347.639 - 4347.6394.441: the physically ill um were
4349.8 - 4349.85.52: eradicated as well as during the war the
4352.08 - 4352.086.84: genocide of European Jews so known as
4355.32 - 4355.325.839: the final solution and the genocide of
4358.92 - 4358.924.04: the cinti and the Roma um who they
4361.159 - 4361.1594.681: called the
4362.96 - 4362.965.52: gypsies others faced a worse fate of
4365.84 - 4365.846.359: falling into the hands of Joseph
4368.48 - 4368.486.239: mangala known as the angel of death
4372.199 - 4372.1995.761: Joseph mangala conducted experiments on
4374.719 - 4374.7193.241: some of the inmates at
4378.92 - 4378.926.12: aitz Joseph mangay was another uh Nazi
4382.719 - 4382.7194.721: figure who today we regard as being one
4385.04 - 4385.044.36: of the most notorious in the entire
4387.44 - 4387.443.52: regime you've got to remember that
4389.4 - 4389.45.2: actually he was only a sort of
4390.96 - 4390.965: mid-ranking SS officer but um as a
4394.6 - 4394.62.96: doctor and I think we should use the
4395.96 - 4395.963.92: word doctor in inverted commer as a
4397.56 - 4397.564.76: doctor in aitz he had power of life and
4399.88 - 4399.884.6: death over hundreds of thousands of
4402.32 - 4402.323.76: people and he committed the most vile
4404.48 - 4404.483.8: experiments
4406.08 - 4406.084.68: with a particular interest in twins
4408.28 - 4408.284: mangala tortured his so-called patients
4410.76 - 4410.764.56: for his own
4412.28 - 4412.284.919: Amusement the Nazis didn't see the Jews
4415.32 - 4415.324.56: as equal human
4417.199 - 4417.1997.52: beings therefore subjecting them to
4419.88 - 4419.884.839: inhumane conditions and torturous
4426.719 - 4426.7194.761: experiments with the coming of the Nazis

4440.12 - 4440.126.039: 1935 the so-called nurenberg laws were
4443.719 - 4443.7196.721: passed the most important effect of
4446.159 - 4446.1597.161: which was to deprive Jews of German
4450.44 - 4450.444.68: citizenship in this way the influence of

4456.48 - 4456.485.52: extinguished and one more potential
4459.08 - 4459.084.32: source of opposition to Nazi policy was

6096.92 - 6096.925.56: inmates were among the biggest group of
6099.08 - 6099.085.4: those experimented on so again sort of
6102.48 - 6102.484.92: through the through the whole period the
6104.48 - 6104.485.52: Nazi regime had established a whole
6107.4 - 6107.44.88: network of concentration camps so with
6110 - 61104.639: daa the very first one with a whole
6112.28 - 6112.284.76: network of concent ation camps spreading
6114.639 - 6114.6394.641: across both Germany and German occupied
6117.04 - 6117.044.28: territory throughout the 1930s and then
6119.28 - 6119.284.28: into the wartime period into a really
6121.32 - 6121.324.799: vast network of different camps and
6123.56 - 6123.565.24: subcamps of course culminating in the
6126.119 - 6126.1195.56: death camps in Poland of which aitz was
6128.8 - 6128.85.439: the most well known and aitz indeed was
6131.679 - 6131.6795.52: the one where a whole range of different
6134.239 - 6134.2396.241: medical experiments um took
6137.199 - 6137.1996.641: place obsessing over twins they became
6140.48 - 6140.485.52: the main subjects for his torture though
6143.84 - 6143.845.359: his earlier experiments had been
6146 - 61465.52: legitimate his work at aitz birkenau was
6149.199 - 6149.1995.241: not he has seen as being one of the most
6151.52 - 6151.526.079: horrific figures of all time but what he
6154.44 - 6154.447.04: also did um with his medical hat on was
6157.599 - 6157.5996.401: to experiment on twins he was absolutely
6161.48 - 6161.484.639: fascinated by twins from a kind of
6164 - 61645.88: anthropological level from a medical
6166.119 - 6166.1195.841: level and what Medics like with twins is
6169.88 - 6169.885.52: that you you have two people who are
6171.96 - 6171.966.36: identical and and if you you can compare
6175.4 - 6175.45.52: and contrast what happens them medically
6178.32 - 6178.325.64: now ethically you can't you know in most
6180.92 - 6180.925.48: normal societies introduce one twin to
6183.96 - 6183.964.44: some disease and the other one not to
6186.4 - 6186.43.839: receive it and then to see how they do
6188.4 - 6188.44.12: you could do that in aitz because
6190.239 - 6190.2394.281: mangala had all these live Human guinea
6192.52 - 6192.523.88: pigs and he would perform disgusting
6194.52 - 6194.523.48: experiments on them he would try to
6196.4 - 6196.45.08: change the color of Their Eyes by
6198 - 61985.76: injecting dye into their eyes he would
6201.48 - 6201.484: dissect them he would it would inject
6203.76 - 6203.763.439: them into their hearts to kill them and
6205.48 - 6205.483.56: then he would dissect them straight away
6207.199 - 6207.1993.281: I mean these are young children you know
6209.04 - 6209.043: and and he was even once having a
6210.48 - 6210.483.6: conversation with some of his fellow
6212.04 - 6212.044.92: doctors um and they were arguing about
6214.08 - 6214.084.32: what what disease some child had and and
6216.96 - 6216.963.679: they were kind of betting about what it
6218.4 - 6218.43.839: was going to be so Mangler says hang on
6220.639 - 6220.6393.52: I'll come back in a few minutes and I'll
6222.239 - 6222.2394: tell you and he came back a few minutes
6224.159 - 6224.1594.04: later said ah you guys are right I was
6226.239 - 6226.2394.721: wrong I looked at his
6228.199 - 6228.1995.801: spleen the implication of that was that
6230.96 - 6230.965.679: mangala went out during the conversation
6234 - 62344.119: killed the child quickly dissected him
6236.639 - 6236.6395.441: and then came back in and carried the
6238.119 - 6238.1193.961: conversation that is what you're dealing
6242.119 - 6242.1193.921: with abandoning medical ethics and
6244.96 - 6244.964.12: research
6246.04 - 6246.046.599: protocols mangala began conducting
6249.08 - 6249.087: horrific experiments on up to 1,500 sets
6252.639 - 6252.6396: of twins many of them
6256.08 - 6256.086.24: children they were not selected for the
6258.639 - 6258.6395.56: gas Chambers lived in separate quarters
6262.32 - 6262.322.919: and were given additional food and
6264.199 - 6264.1994.52: Medical
6265.239 - 6265.2396.081: Care in exchange though they became the
6268.719 - 6268.7195.361: unwilling subjects of inhumane
6271.32 - 6271.325.72: experiments at the hands of
6274.08 - 6274.086.32: mangala of course the survival rate of
6277.04 - 6277.046.4: those experiments um was very poor and
6280.4 - 6280.45.36: even if the victims managed to survive
6283.44 - 6283.445.52: they were usually either shot to death
6285.76 - 6285.765.32: or killed by lethal injection
6288.96 - 6288.964.08: afterwards the development of gas
6291.08 - 6291.084.119: Chambers allowed the Nazis to speed
6293.04 - 6293.044.36: speed up the process of
6295.199 - 6295.1994.201: elimination the victims were stripped of
6297.4 - 6297.44.6: their clothing and crowded into the gas
6299.4 - 6299.43.92: Chambers where they died of Suffocation
6302 - 63024.92: within a short
6303.32 - 6303.326.319: time conditions in the camp were
6306.92 - 6306.925.92: unimaginable despite the horrific crimes
6309.639 - 6309.6396.56: committed at aitz Joseph mangala had
6312.84 - 6312.843.359: escaped for
6319.8 - 6319.84.96: now the mosad agents had to figure out
6322.599 - 6322.5994.64: how they would smuggle ikeman out of the
6324.76 - 6324.766.28: country without being
6327.239 - 6327.2397.041: caught near midnight on May 20th
6331.04 - 6331.045.199: 1960 Adolf ikan was Sedated by an
6334.28 - 6334.284.72: Israeli
6336.239 - 6336.2394.681: doctor mosad agents dressed him as a
6339 - 63393.639: flight attendant and smuggled ikan out
6340.92 - 6340.926.199: of Argentina on a
6342.639 - 6342.6397.361: plane it was a tense and dangerous
6347.119 - 6347.1197.201: Journey they arrived in Israel on May
6350 - 63507.08: 22nd after stopping at takar on the way
6354.32 - 6354.325.76: in Argentina news of the abduction was
6357.08 - 6357.084.96: met with a violent wave of anti-Semitism
6360.08 - 6360.084.639: carried out by far-right
6362.04 - 6362.044.599: movements the Israeli Court battled with
6364.719 - 6364.7193.761: the Argentinian government over the
6366.639 - 6366.6394: abduction until both came to an
6368.48 - 6368.488.239: agreement to end the
6370.639 - 6370.6398.641: dispute I would say a symbolic
6376.719 - 6376.7193.88: punishment according to certain moral
6379.28 - 6379.283.72: and legal
6380.599 - 6380.5995.801: principles but the main aim is not
6383 - 63835.88: whether iPhone would get shoot or hang
6386.4 - 6386.44.92: the main point is Ion should be exposed
6388.88 - 6388.885.48: and through iPhone
6391.32 - 6391.325.08: Nazism most of us you would prefer not
6394.36 - 6394.368.239: to have
6396.4 - 6396.46.199: kill because we are fundamentally Arians
6404.719 - 6404.7193: against

6425.719 - 6425.7195.041: 1961 was very controversial but it also
6429.04 - 6429.044.119: of course attracted a great deal of
6430.76 - 6430.765.04: international attention as
6433.159 - 6433.1595.881: well the legal bias for the charges

7002.84 - 7002.844.879: circumstances of this conversation but I
7005.719 - 7005.7194.321: do know that these gentlemen were
7007.719 - 7007.7195: standing together or sitting together
7010.04 - 7010.045.4: and were discussing this subject uh
7012.719 - 7012.7194.681: quite bluntly quite differently from the
7015.44 - 7015.444.12: language which I had to use later in the
7017.4 - 7017.46.839: record during the conversation they
7019.56 - 7019.564.679: minced no words about it at all
7040.66 - 7040.663.039: [Music]
7047.8 - 7047.83.22: [Music]
7058.76 - 7058.765.56: I might say furthermore your honor that

7064.32 - 7064.328.16: this unless I had later remember that I
7068.239 - 7068.2397.081: told myself look here I told myself even
7072.48 - 7072.485.119: this guyard who was known as one of
7075.32 - 7075.323.56: these uncles who was a great stickler
7077.599 - 7077.5996.48: for
7078.88 - 7078.887.719: legalities he too uses a language which
7084.079 - 7084.0796: is not at all in accordance with the
7086.599 - 7086.5996.161: spirit of paragraphs of the law this
7090.079 - 7090.0795.481: incident remained engraved in in my
7092.76 - 7092.765.319: memory and recalls the entire subject to
7095.56 - 7095.564.039: my mind when he was questioned he
7098.079 - 7098.0793.6: claimed that he was only following
7099.599 - 7099.5994.281: orders he claimed not to be responsible
7101.679 - 7101.6794.321: for any of the executions and said he
7103.88 - 7103.883.96: was just involved in
7106 - 71064.079: transportation again that's the kind of
7107.84 - 7107.844.16: line used about following orders and not
7110.079 - 7110.0793.281: really admitting responsibility for the
7112 - 71125.599: final
7113.36 - 7113.364.239: solution what did he say about this
7118.639 - 7118.6396.56: subject in detail I do not not details
7122.96 - 7122.965.239: in general what did he say about this
7125.199 - 7125.1993: theme
7146.239 - 7146.2395.92: I cannot remember it in detail your
7148.88 - 7148.887.239: honor but
7152.159 - 7152.1596.04: uh they spoke about methods for killing
7156.119 - 7156.1195.04: about liquidation about
7158.199 - 7158.1994.48: extermination I was busy with my records
7161.159 - 7161.1594.801: I had to make the prepar ation for
7162.679 - 7162.6795.96: taking down the minutes and I could not
7165.96 - 7165.966: uh perk up my ears and listen to
7168.639 - 7168.6397.401: everything that was said but it filtered
7171.96 - 7171.965.92: through the small room and I caught uh
7176.04 - 7176.044.159: fragments of this conversation it was a
7177.88 - 7177.885.68: small room so from time to time I heard
7180.199 - 7180.1995.721: a word or two I believe that this was
7183.56 - 7183.563.78: the official part of the meeting of the
7185.92 - 7185.924.47: conference
7187.34 - 7187.343.05: [Music]
7193.599 - 7193.5996.441: the official part did not take too
7197.239 - 7197.2396.041: long was this in the official part of
7200.04 - 7200.045.72: the conference or not it was my belief
7203.28 - 7203.284.16: that this was in the official conference
7205.76 - 7205.763.879: because should this should have been
7207.44 - 7207.445: included in the protocol of the meeting
7209.639 - 7209.6392.801: although nothing is
7220.96 - 7220.964: mentioned for
7265.079 - 7265.0794.56: of course it was in the official part
7267.239 - 7267.2397.281: your honor but again this official part
7269.639 - 7269.6397.281: had two sub divisions the first part
7274.52 - 7274.524.52: where everyone was quiet and listened to
7276.92 - 7276.924.799: the various lectures and then in the
7279.04 - 7279.043.639: second part everyone spoke out of turn
7281.719 - 7281.7194.121: and
7282.679 - 7282.6795.96: people uh would go around Butler's
7285.84 - 7285.844.239: adjutants and would give out liquor well
7288.639 - 7288.6393.6: I don't want to say there was an
7290.079 - 7290.0795: atmosphere of drunkenness there it was
7292.239 - 7292.2394.281: an official atmosphere but uh
7295.079 - 7295.0795: nevertheless it was not one of these
7296.52 - 7296.525.96: stiff formal official Affairs where
7300.079 - 7300.0795.801: everyone spoke in turn but people just
7302.48 - 7302.487.32: talk cross purposes and where they also
7305.88 - 7305.886.799: recorded by the shorten
7309.8 - 7309.85.96: typist on December 12th

7353.44 - 7353.444.679: spending the next few weeks in the gross

7386.96 - 7386.965.44: released him and mangala took that as
7389.28 - 7389.283.12: his opportunity to
7393.159 - 7393.1596.201: flee making it to Bavaria mangala worked
7396.52 - 7396.524.719: as a farmand in rosenheim his wealthy
7399.36 - 7399.363.719: family made plans to help him immigrate
7401.239 - 7401.2393.281: to South America where he would be
7403.079 - 7403.0794.08: harder to

7407.159 - 7407.1594.161: know along with normal Farm laborers but
7409.8 - 7409.83.319: it's clear he's a much more intellectual
7411.32 - 7411.325.879: figure than those around him they all
7413.119 - 7413.1194.08: know that he's you know got something to
7424.76 - 7424.764.72: hide what mangala has is is a very
7427.52 - 7427.524.88: wealthy background because the mangala
7429.48 - 7429.485.079: family produced farm machinery in in
7432.4 - 7432.43.799: southern Germany for decades and so

8505.92 - 8505.924.24: fantastic
8507.64 - 8507.645.24: exaggeration but this is what you would
8510.16 - 8510.165.72: actually be obliged to conclude if you
8512.88 - 8512.888.32: were to acquit these

8824.24 - 8824.245.079: why but
8825.96 - 8825.966.16: nberg is more than an answer to a
8829.319 - 8829.3196.16: question as Justice Jackson
8832.12 - 8832.126.44: said this trial is part of the great
8835.479 - 8835.4796.281: effort to make the peace more
8838.56 - 8838.566.24: secure it Con stitutes juridical action
8841.76 - 8841.766.639: of a kind to ensure that those who start
8844.8 - 8844.87.88: a war will pay for it
8848.399 - 8848.39910.361: personally nberg stands as a warning to
8852.68 - 8852.686.08: all those who plan and wage aggressive
8860.359 - 8860.3595.04: War again one of the most barbaric
8863.68 - 8863.684.4: figures of the entire third right was a
8865.399 - 8865.3995.481: man called Rudolph hurse now he was the
8868.08 - 8868.084.52: commandant of aitz uh and as result as
8870.88 - 8870.883.8: you know probably got about a million
8872.6 - 8872.65.759: people you know against his name who he
8874.68 - 8874.686.28: had murdered he was found guilty and he
8878.359 - 8878.3596.881: was executed in April
8880.96 - 8880.965.92: 1947 he was taken back to aitz to
8885.24 - 8885.244.68: outside the house where he and his
8886.88 - 8886.884.88: family had lived he was executed there
8889.92 - 8889.923.84: at the place where he had lived and at
8891.76 - 8891.764.84: the place where he had sent millions of
8893.76 - 8893.766.559: people to die um during his time as
8896.6 - 8896.63.719: commandant at aitz
8901.96 - 8901.964.28: I think it's important to say that the
8904.08 - 8904.085.56: perpetrators really sort of had this
8906.24 - 8906.245.119: sense of impunity really um perpetrators
8909.64 - 8909.643.28: um of these kinds of crimes until that
8911.359 - 8911.3593.721: point of nurenberg so there was this
8912.92 - 8912.925.68: sense that they'd get away with it so
8915.08 - 8915.085.279: Hitler very famously told his SS uh
8918.6 - 8918.63.6: during the second world war who now
8920.359 - 8920.3593.721: remembers the Armenians and the
8922.2 - 8922.23.88: Armenians had been the victims of a
8924.08 - 8924.084.8: genocide during the course of the first
8926.08 - 8926.084.8: world war with great fatalities there'
8928.88 - 8928.883.92: sort of been a lot of talk at that point
8930.88 - 8930.883.64: about bringing the perpetrators to
8932.8 - 8932.83.4: justice but they'd all got away with it
8934.52 - 8934.523: so I think that the the most important
8936.2 - 8936.23.52: well one of the most important points
8937.52 - 8937.524.16: about neurenberg is that this sort of
8939.72 - 8939.723.32: sense of impunity that the that they'd
8941.68 - 8941.683.759: never be punished that they could get
8943.04 - 8943.045.12: away with anything they liked so after
8945.439 - 8945.4394.481: 1945 this began to change and the laws
8948.16 - 8948.165.08: international law began to change as
8949.92 - 8949.925.68: well so in this sense Newburg was
8953.24 - 8953.245.4: unprecedented but also it set a
8955.6 - 8955.66.12: precedent um for later Trials of this
8958.64 - 8958.645.56: kind so it set the example for Trials of
8961.72 - 8961.724.4: later genocides like the international
8964.2 - 8964.23.88: criminal tribunal of the former
8966.12 - 8966.125.199: Yugoslavia and the international
8968.08 - 8968.083.239: criminal tribunal at
8972.24 - 8972.244.48: Rwanda it took a long time for the
8974.399 - 8974.3993.96: German people to really come to terms
8976.72 - 8976.722.92: with what had been done in their name I
8978.359 - 8978.3594: think a lot of German people throughout
8979.64 - 8979.644.679: the war had had had more than an inkling
8982.359 - 8982.3594.721: but I don't think they knew the extent
8984.319 - 8984.3195.801: of the savagery of what went on you know
8987.08 - 8987.085.16: behind those miles upon miles of Barbed
8990.12 - 8990.125.199: are and inside those huts and inside
8992.24 - 8992.244.72: those chambers of death effectively and
8995.319 - 8995.3194.441: I think that when it was finally
8996.96 - 8996.965.2: revealed to them and and when you know
8999.76 - 8999.764.599: Justice started being done I think any
9002.16 - 9002.163.6: reasonable German started realizing that
9004.359 - 9004.3595.441: actually yes there should be some form
9005.76 - 9005.766.96: of Retribution but I think also there
9009.8 - 9009.85.4: was also a feeling not just in Germany
9012.72 - 9012.724.92: but also amongst the Allies that you
9015.2 - 9015.24.199: couldn't spend decade upon decade
9017.64 - 9017.644.4: carrying out tens of thousands of
9019.399 - 9019.3994.561: manhunts for all these people I think
9022.04 - 9022.044.279: you've also got a feeling not just in
9023.96 - 9023.965.24: Germany but also in in the former Allied
9026.319 - 9026.3195.721: Nations that actually it's time to move
9029.2 - 9029.26.119: on by the late 1940s you got a decision
9032.04 - 9032.045.439: do we keep chasing hundreds of thousands
9035.319 - 9035.3193.921: of war criminals do we keep having these
9037.479 - 9037.4794.041: trials do we keep having this
9039.24 - 9039.243.88: retribution because soon you know people
9041.52 - 9041.524.32: going to ask what crimes did we commit
9043.12 - 9043.122.72: on the Allied
9046.8 - 9046.84.84: side you've got a very strong sense in
9049.479 - 9049.4794.321: Germany and indeed in the former Allied
9051.64 - 9051.644.639: Nations Britain America France you name
9053.8 - 9053.85: it that actually by the 19 end of the
9056.279 - 9056.2794.361: 1940s you can't just have these endless
9058.8 - 9058.83.679: man hunts and war crimes trials going on
9060.64 - 9060.644.04: for decade after decade you've actually
9062.479 - 9062.4793.441: got to rebuild Germany uh you've got to
9064.68 - 9064.683.2: have a prosperous Germany in the middle
9065.92 - 9065.923.76: of Europe you've also got a new enemy in
9067.88 - 9067.883.439: the form of the Soviet Union you've all
9069.68 - 9069.683.799: got to work together and it's pretty
9071.319 - 9071.3194.12: hard to work together if you keep having
9073.479 - 9073.4794.281: retributive Justice going on in the
9075.439 - 9075.4395.481: country of your new friend it ain't
9077.76 - 9077.764.8: going to work frankly and so by by 1949
9080.92 - 9080.924.399: for example the British war crimes unit
9082.56 - 9082.564.799: is simply wound up after only 4 years
9085.319 - 9085.3194.16: they've only bought a relative handful
9087.359 - 9087.3594.641: of Nazis to Justice there's still tons
9089.479 - 9089.4795.641: of thousands of them out there and and
9092 - 90925.92: you know many of them remained free for
9095.12 - 9095.125.12: decades or if they receive sentences
9097.92 - 9097.924.559: those sentences got less and less severe
9100.24 - 9100.245.199: as the years went by so if you were
9102.479 - 9102.4795.361: captured in 1946 you may have hanged if
9105.439 - 9105.4395.04: you were captured in 1956 you may have
9107.84 - 9107.845.08: got a couple of years in prison so
9110.479 - 9110.4796.091: you see this diminution actually a lot
9112.92 - 9112.9217.479: of Nazis got away with it scotf free
9116.57 - 9116.5713.829: [Music]
9137.41 - 9137.4112.23: [Music]
9147.479 - 9147.4795.361: the horrors of War plagued the world
9149.64 - 9149.645.799: with destruction violence and
9152.84 - 9152.845.36: death when the Allied countries began to
9155.439 - 9155.4394.161: invade Germany they had no idea of the
9158.2 - 9158.24.4: Hidden death
9159.6 - 9159.65.92: camps they were not prepared for what
9162.6 - 9162.62.92: they were about to
9166.92 - 9166.926.72: witness in 1942 in the early hours of of
9170 - 91706.76: one morning we were called outside alud
9173.64 - 9173.645.12: Rous and we heard rumors by then but
9176.76 - 9176.763.96: they were only rumors because we had no
9178.76 - 9178.765: communication with the outside world
9180.72 - 9180.726.08: they said that the young children and
9183.76 - 9183.765.599: old people are being murdered you know
9186.8 - 9186.84.96: all over the country so we took our
9189.359 - 9189.3595.801: grandparents we hid them in the
9191.76 - 9191.765.92: Attic fully expecting to come back
9195.16 - 9195.165.84: soon in fact it was the last time we
9197.68 - 9197.686: ever saw them the we later land they
9201 - 92014.68: were all shot and having got rest in a
9203.68 - 9203.685.03: hurry we had to run out into the streets
9205.68 - 9205.685.2: and follow one another like sheep to the
9208.71 - 9208.715.21: [Music]
9210.88 - 9210.885.36: slaughter first of all at arrival the
9213.92 - 9213.924.76: men and women went to different parts so
9216.24 - 9216.246: this is when you had to say goodbye to
9218.68 - 9218.686.12: your husband your father your brother
9222.24 - 9222.245.76: that and knowing that perhaps you will
9224.8 - 9224.87.479: never ever see them on Earth so you can
9228 - 92286.319: imagine a very very emotional crying and
9232.279 - 9232.2795.481: holding on and
9234.319 - 9234.3196.881: terrible and then this next thing was
9237.76 - 9237.765.16: with so with a women um selection we
9241.2 - 9241.25.159: lost half our
9242.92 - 9242.927.28: transport um all little kids older

9254.04 - 9254.044.72: to the wrong
9255.319 - 9255.3195.481: side wrong side meant immediate
9258.76 - 9258.764.599: immediate guessing
9260.8 - 9260.85.28: and they told us that they didn't spare
9263.359 - 9263.3595.161: any feeling so you can imagine how a
9266.08 - 9266.085.12: mother had just been separated from her
9268.52 - 9268.526.2: toddler so how she felt when she was
9271.2 - 9271.23.52: told he's already
9275.76 - 9275.765.639: killed and then they gave an order for
9279.08 - 9279.086.72: parents to hand over old children up to
9281.399 - 9281.3997.321: 18 years of age to describe the scene is
9285.8 - 9285.85.85: not possible I can only give you an idea

9625.6 - 9625.64.48: being I don't even know how I got
9627.359 - 9627.3595.801: outside but I remember being propped up
9630.08 - 9630.083.08: against the wall of the
9640 - 96405: Barrack the Germans attempted to hide
9642.72 - 9642.725.08: all evidence of the mass murder they had
9645 - 96454.88: been committing for years demolishing as
9647.8 - 9647.84.639: much of the camps as possible once they
9649.88 - 9649.885.439: knew the Allied Forces were getting
9652.439 - 9652.4395.081: closer death marches forcing the
9655.319 - 9655.3193.481: prisoners to walk for hundreds of miles
9657.52 - 9657.524.04: away from the
9658.8 - 9658.85.32: camps those unfit to withstand the
9661.56 - 9661.565.08: journey would be left behind to die or
9664.12 - 9664.124.68: shot on the spot if they were holding up
9666.64 - 9666.642.16: the
9669.76 - 9669.767.2: March Ziggy already was quite weak he
9673.96 - 9673.964.64: already had the beginnings of tyers I
9676.96 - 9676.964.04: caught tyers I don't know whether he
9678.6 - 9678.64.08: infected me but we we supported I had to
9681 - 96814.16: give him everything you because we were
9682.68 - 9682.686: marching at a certain Pace accompanied
9685.16 - 9685.167: by armed German guards and anyone who
9688.68 - 9688.686.08: could not keep Pace with the column and
9692.16 - 9692.164.72: F began to trail behind they were just
9694.76 - 9694.765.4: taking aside shot in the head and left
9696.88 - 9696.885.96: by the wayside so the only safe place
9700.16 - 9700.165.56: was to be in the middle of the column
9702.84 - 9702.845.439: and since Z was already quite weak had
9705.72 - 9705.725: it not been for people like him he alone
9708.279 - 9708.2794.921: couldn't have done it he was too weak I
9710.72 - 9710.725.759: I was not a tower of strength either and
9713.2 - 9713.26.52: every day here every single day your
9716.479 - 9716.4795.161: your life was hanging on a thread when
9719.72 - 9719.724.48: we went to bed we weren't sure that
9721.64 - 9721.645.44: we'll wake up in the morning all of us
9724.2 - 9724.24.48: were the same and if you did wake up you
9727.08 - 9727.083.04: couldn't be sure that you would still be
9728.68 - 9728.683.32: alive in the evening if you couldn't if
9730.12 - 9730.125.319: you couldn't get off the
9732 - 97326.52: bank you finished yes I I've been asked
9735.439 - 9735.4394.681: asked in the past whether I had any
9738.52 - 9738.524.56: thoughts of
9740.12 - 9740.125.64: what would we do after our
9743.08 - 9743.085.6: Liberation it's it's an impossible
9745.76 - 9745.765.04: question because in the camp our
9748.68 - 9748.684.679: thoughts were just how to survive that
9750.8 - 9750.85.12: day how to stay out of
9753.359 - 9753.3595.441: trouble because the safest thing to do
9755.92 - 9755.926.04: was to be anonymous not to be noticed if
9758.8 - 9758.85.84: he did anything wrong um that usually
9761.96 - 9761.962.68: spelled
9765.279 - 9765.2795.601: trouble we were not friends we were
9767.84 - 9767.846.32: brothers we had no body
9770.88 - 9770.886.2: else if one of us managed to get a crumb
9774.16 - 9774.166.56: of bread in addition to our very basic
9777.08 - 9777.087.04: Russians we would share it that that's
9780.72 - 9780.723.4: was was friendship meant to
9784.479 - 9784.4795.281: us the reason I was told the transport
9787.84 - 9787.843.24: because at the time I was working in a
9789.76 - 9789.765.32: place called the
9791.08 - 9791.087.199: babai where we were plating plats for
9795.08 - 9795.085.84: the cleaning of the guns they were T
9798.279 - 9798.2793.801: material that had to be planted
9800.92 - 9800.923.76: different
9802.08 - 9802.087.48: sicknesses for cleaning of their
9804.68 - 9804.688.16: guns and by the end of 1944 I was pretty
9809.56 - 9809.566.24: sick I had very bad dentry
9812.84 - 9812.845.599: actually and the plats were tested by
9815.8 - 9815.84.88: the couple daily he used to put his foot
9818.439 - 9818.4395.241: on it and stretch it and if they broke
9820.68 - 9820.685.88: he were in trouble but mine broke at the
9823.68 - 9823.687.2: end of December cuz I was really had no
9826.56 - 9826.568.12: strength at all and uh he just gave me a
9830.88 - 9830.883.8: lovely slap and told me
9834.8 - 9834.85.44: transport didn't know what it meant but
9837.12 - 9837.125.04: transport it meant the crematorium but
9840.24 - 9840.244.76: to my knowledge at that time the
9842.16 - 9842.166.08: crematorium stopped working round about
9845 - 98455.92: October November I think
9848.24 - 9848.246.039: November so I didn't know what transport
9850.92 - 9850.926.08: meant but obviously meant a journey to
9854.279 - 9854.2796.361: somewhere else and that was the journey
9857 - 98575.72: to bson that's why they sent me to bson
9860.64 - 9860.644.759: or maybe there was also another reason I
9862.72 - 9862.724.88: think the Russians were coming very near
9865.399 - 9865.3994.96: and they were emptying the camp cuz long
9867.6 - 9867.65.32: not long after that I think it was the
9870.359 - 9870.3595.721: best March when people didn't have the
9872.92 - 9872.925.76: trains anymore or the train that took
9876.08 - 9876.085.359: them to bson or anywhere else and they
9878.68 - 9878.682.759: had to March
9883.479 - 9883.4796.241: out the journey was cattle
9886.279 - 9886.2795.801: wagons I don't know how many of us
9889.72 - 9889.726.08: crammed into one
9892.08 - 9892.087.04: wagon terribly cold Germany at that part
9895.8 - 9895.88.2: of the world in the winter was extremely
9899.12 - 9899.126.88: cold and when we left aitz we went
9904 - 99045.92: through
9906 - 99066.24: a what we call the cleansing procedure
9909.92 - 9909.925.6: through the washrooms and everything and
9912.24 - 9912.244.76: you issued clothes and actually I was
9915.52 - 9915.524: issued with
9917 - 99177.6: a silk coat
9919.52 - 9919.529.12: which was the traditional clothes for
9924.6 - 9924.64.04: the very religious
9928.84 - 9928.847.519: Jews and that is
9931.24 - 9931.248.92: all and um in the wagon was terribly
9936.359 - 9936.3595.761: cold my feet were literally like ice so
9940.16 - 9940.165.72: I took my shoes off
9942.12 - 9942.127.48: eventually to rub my feet and at that
9945.88 - 9945.887.28: very moment the doors opened and the
9949.6 - 9949.67.36: Germans were screaming Rouse Rouse Rouse
9953.16 - 9953.163.8: you know couldn't find my
9957.08 - 9957.083.72: shoe so
9960.84 - 9960.847.88: barefooted I was standing on in the
9964.84 - 9964.847.479: snow about a meter deep at the
9968.72 - 9968.727.4: time and um we were
9972.319 - 9972.3196.04: counted and marched from the end of the
9976.12 - 9976.123.48: line which to my mind at the time was
9978.359 - 9978.3594.561: Burgen
9979.6 - 9979.67.44: I'm told now is called
9982.92 - 9982.926.24: H and uh we marched into the bson camp
9987.04 - 9987.045.72: and I remember going under a
9989.16 - 9989.166.96: bridge and the Germans were lining right
9992.76 - 9992.766.12: across the bridge laughing and shouting
9996.12 - 9996.125.88: and insulting us the best way they
9998.88 - 9998.886.36: could and then we arrived eventually I
10002 - 100027.52: don't know how what the distance was and
10005.24 - 10005.244.28: we arrived in bson
10016.92 - 10016.925.04: in every Camp Allied soldiers
10019.68 - 10019.685: encountered appalling
10021.96 - 10021.965.76: scenes Bergen bellson was liberated by
10024.68 - 10024.685.88: British forces on the 15th of April
10027.72 - 10027.724.88: 1945 it had become exceptionally
